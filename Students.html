<p><font size="4" color="#ffffff"> We have a strong tradition of Student Voice activities, which provide opportunities for Pupils to become involved and even direct School life.
There are many links here to other School areas, especially Enrichment, PSHE and the house system. The following are the main forums and avenues of Student Voice,
but also new projects may be started as initiatives change.</p></font>
<h1> <font face="Open Sans" color="#ffffff" size="5"><b>Student Committee</font> </h1></b>
<p><font size="4" color="#ffffff">  The role of the Committee System is to give Pupils the ownership over key areas of school development and, as such, 
the Committees running may vary year to year. Current Committees are PSHE, Health and Welfare, Literacy, School Environment and Ecological, Curriculum,
Healthy Schools, Global, E â€“ learning and Sports.</p></font>
<h1> <font face="Open Sans" color="#ffffff" size="5"><b>Student Learning Conference</font> </h1></b>
<p><font size="4" color="#ffffff">  This is an annual event held every year. Pupils from the School Committees from all year groups meet to discuss and 
review the learning in general and be consulted on key issues.</p><font>
